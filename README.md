Build a basic chat application using WebSockets
WebSockets are a technology for creating real-time, bi-directional communication channels over a single TCP connection. They help build applications that require low-latency, high-frequency communication, such as chat applications, online gaming, and collaborative software.


In this tutorial, we will be building a real-time chat application using WebSockets and the Socket.IO library. We will use Node.js as the server-side language and React as the client-side technology. However, the principles discussed in this tutorial can be applied to any language or technology that supports WebSockets.


Prerequisites
Before we begin, you should have the following prerequisites:

Basic understanding of JavaScript
Basic understanding of Node.js and React
Basic understanding of web development concepts, such as HTTP and HTML
Node.js and npm installed on your machine
React developer tools installed in your browser (optional, but helpful for debugging)
Setting up the Server
Setting up the Client
Handling Messages on the Server
Conclusion
This tutorial taught us how to create a real-time chat application using WebSockets and the Socket.IO library. We have set up a Node.js server and a React client and implemented the WebSocket communication using the useWebSocket hook on the client side and the connection, message, and disconnect events on the server side.


You can extend this application in many ways, such as adding user authentication, storing messages in a database, and implementing more advanced features like message editing and deletion. I hope this tutorial has provided a good foundation for you to build on.
